To access the backend code, ssh onto 128.113.126.62 using ssh rcsid@128.113.126.62 
and your RPI password. This server is configured so only professor Sturmann and our group 
members have access to ssh in. After sshing, you can use the command 
cd /var/www/FlaskApp/FlaskApp/ to view the backend code using nano \_\_init__.py or
any other text editor of chocie. The creation/scripts of the SQL tables can be viewed using nano seed_data.sql and nano populate.sql aswell.
